# AGENTS.md

## Mission

Deliver high-quality outcomes while reducing average token cost per task over time.

## Core KPIs

- `success_rate`: Completed tasks without rework.
- `avg_tokens_per_task`: Mean token usage per completed task.
- `rework_rate`: Fraction of tasks reopened after first delivery.
- `skill_hit_rate`: Fraction of tasks solved with existing skills.

## Operating Loop

1. Classify request by task type and risk.
2. Reuse existing skill if available; avoid rebuilding context from scratch.
3. Execute with the minimum context needed.
4. Validate output with concrete checks (tests, lint, expected files).
5. Record failures and high-cost runs in knowledge base.
6. Promote proven fixes into `AGENTS.md` or skills.

## Token Policy

- Keep high-level policy in this file; move details to references.
- Prefer scripts for repeated deterministic work.
- Avoid duplicating the same guidance across files.
- Store large schemas and examples under `references/`, not in main prompts.
- Summarize long execution outputs before carrying them forward.

## Skill Lifecycle Policy

Create or update a skill when any condition is true:

- Same workflow appears `>= 3` times in 7 days.
- Average token cost is significantly above baseline for that task type.
- Failure recurs with the same root cause twice.

Skill quality gates:

1. Name is normalized to lowercase hyphen-case.
2. `SKILL.md` keeps only core workflow and trigger guidance.
3. Variant details live in `references/`.
4. Repeated code lives in `scripts/` and is executable.
5. Skill is validated before adoption.

## Project-Local Skill

Use project-local skill `aoso-repo-maintainer` for repository maintenance tasks:

- path: `skills/aoso-repo-maintainer/`
- trigger: any change to `scripts/`, `skills/`, CI, or workflow docs.
- required workflow:
  1. `skills/aoso-repo-maintainer/scripts/sync_runtime_to_installable_skill.sh` (when runtime scripts changed)
  2. Update docs when command behavior changed.
  3. `skills/aoso-repo-maintainer/scripts/check_readme_sync.sh` (README.md and README_CN.md must stay synchronized)
  4. `skills/aoso-repo-maintainer/scripts/validate_repo_workflow.sh`
  5. `skills/aoso-repo-maintainer/scripts/auto_commit.sh --message "<commit-message>"`

## Error KB Policy

For every notable failure, create one file under `knowledge-base/errors/` named:

`YYYY-MM-DD-short-slug.md`

Required fields:

- date
- task_type
- severity
- symptom
- root_cause
- fix
- prevention_rule
- trigger_signals
- token_cost_estimate
- status

## Weekly Governance

Run `./scripts/weekly_review.sh` once per week and review:

1. Top recurring root causes.
2. High-cost task types.
3. Skills to add, split, or simplify.
4. Rules to promote, rewrite, or remove.

## Change Control

- Add rules only if backed by at least one concrete incident or measurable gain.
- Remove rules that no longer provide measurable value.
- Keep policy concise and operational.

## Definition of Done

- Task result is correct and verifiable.
- Token usage is logged when unusually high.
- New failures are captured in error KB.
- Follow-up rule/skill updates are clearly identified.
